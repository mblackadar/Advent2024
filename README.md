# Advent2024

My solutions for Advent of Code 2024. A single executable is created which can solve all of the puzzles.

## Requirements

CMake and a compiler with C++20 compatibility is required.

## Running the Program

The program should be run in a terminal with 3 arguments:

- Day number
- A or B (indicating which part of the puzzle to solve)
- Path to input file

Here is an example, running the program for part B of day 2.

```
> .\Advent2024.exe 2 B ..\..\..\input\day2.txt
674
```
